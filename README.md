# Solutions of Programming Challenges

## Description

I am bored of learning stuff theoretically. I have tried learning Algorithms
from the book [The Algorithm Design Manual][algorithm_design_manual] before, I
failed and couldn't able to read after chapter one. This time I want to try some
other approach to read this book. No or very less knowledge of Mathematical
theories quoted in the book is one of the reason preventing to continue. I take
pause, learn theory and then continue the book again. The book [Programming
Challenges][programming_challenges] is quoted at [The Algorithm Design
Manual][algorithm_design_manual] for related exercises. In this repository, I
try to solve those quoted exercises by my own.

## Programming languages

* You can find the solutions in C or Python.
